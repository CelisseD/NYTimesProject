# NYTimesProject

This project was built as part of UCF's Coding Bootcamp, May 2019 cohort. For this project, we used the New York Times API to build a search engine that takes a user keyword input and returns articles related to that keyword. Optionally the user can enter a year range of articles to return, as well as a number limit.
